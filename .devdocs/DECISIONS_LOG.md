## Architecture: KF6 & Qt6 Native Plugin
* **Decision**: Target KDE Frameworks 6 exclusively.
* **Justification**: Modern KDE applications (Kate, KDevelop) have migrated to Qt6/KF6.
* **Impact**: Requires `kf6-*` packages and modern C++17/20.

## Backend: Local Llama.cpp REST API
* **Decision**: Communicate via HTTP POST using `QNetworkAccessManager`.
* **Justification**: Llama.cpp provides standard `/completion` and `/chat/completions` endpoints.

## Network: Async QNetworkReply Handling
* **Decision**: Overwrite ongoing requests by calling `abort()` and `deleteLater()` on the old pointers, and use `sender()` in slots.
* **Justification**: Prevents crashes or signal cross-talk when multiple requests (e.g., chat vs refactor) overlap asynchronously in `LlamaClient`.

## User Interface: Chat Interactions
* **Decision**: Implement `QEventFilter` on `QTextEdit` to capture `Enter` for sending messages, and auto-populate a welcome guide on load.
* **Justification**: Empty chat panels feel like non-functional stubs. Intercepting `Enter` matches standard chat UX and greatly enhances usability.

## Architecture: Native Integration
* **Decision**: Remove custom `ComparisonView` popup. Pipe LLM edits directly into `KTextEditor::Document` via `replaceText`.
* **Justification**: Custom popups fight the host IDE. Editing the native buffer lets the user rely on the IDE's built-in Git Diff and Undo functionality, shifting from a "slap-on app" to a deeply integrated native plugin.

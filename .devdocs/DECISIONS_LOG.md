## UI: Throttled Streaming and Native Rendering
* **Decision**: Added a 50ms QTimer to `ChatMessageWidget` to throttle UI updates during LLM generation and implemented `paintEvent` for native rounded corners instead of using QSS `border-radius`.
* **Justification**: Updating complex markdown layouts on every single LLM token caused severe UI thread blocking and lag. Batching updates every 50ms resolves this. Native QPainter rendering avoids QSS bugs on KDevelop's varying dock themes.

## Context: Expanded Token Limits
* **Decision**: Increased the hardcoded truncation limits in `ContextManager` from 200 lines to 1000 lines for @file references, and from 50,000 characters to 120,000 characters for the active document.
* **Justification**: Modern LLMs have large context windows. Restricting @file to 200 lines arbitrarily truncates essential code needed for accurate refactoring and chat responses.

## UI: QScrollArea and Native KTextEditor Widgets
* **Decision**: Abandoned `QListView` and `QStyledItemDelegate` in favor of a `QScrollArea` containing a `QVBoxLayout` of custom `ChatMessageWidget` instances. Used `KTextEditor::Document` and `KTextEditor::View` to render LLM code blocks, and added explicit "Apply to Editor" buttons.
* **Justification**: Manual painting of a `QTextDocument` on a `QListView` delegate was incapable of dynamically word-wrapping text correctly in a responsive IDE dock, leading to visually broken text cut-offs. Additionally, embedding real IDE text widgets enables full 100% accurate C++ syntax highlighting and native IDE interactions (like inserting code directly into the active tab), fulfilling the user's requirements for "proper blocks" and interaction.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-24 10:07## Qt6 UI: Explicit QFlags Type Casting for Markdown Features
* **Decision**: Wrapped `QTextDocument::MarkdownDialectGitHub | QTextDocument::MarkdownNoHTML` in `QTextDocument::MarkdownFeatures(...)` inside `ChatMessageDelegate::createDoc()`.
* **Justification**: In Qt 6, bitwise OR on enum values evaluates to `int`, which triggers strict type checking errors when passed to functions taking `QFlags<T>`. Explicitly constructing `QTextDocument::MarkdownFeatures` satisfies GCC type rules without `-fpermissive`.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-24 10:04

## Architecture: Structural Normalization & Self-Contained Qt Headers
* **Decision**: Sanitized `src/context/ContextManager.h` and `src/ui/ChatMessageDelegate.h` by removing all stashed Git conflict markers and ensuring explicit `#include <QCache>`, `#include <QHash>`, `#include <QFileSystemWatcher>`, and `#include <QTextDocument>` header directives.
* **Justification**: Completely eliminates preprocessor and Qt MOC syntax failures caused by Git conflict markers. Guarantees complete class definitions for template types (`QCache<QString, QTextDocument>`), restoring 100% build compatibility for MOC and GCC compilation without temporary hotfixes.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-24 10:00

## Build & Header Inclusions: Explicit Include Directives for Qt Header Self-Containment
* **Decision**: Added `#include <QMessageBox>` to `src/ui/AiChatWidget.h`, `#include <QTextDocument>` to `src/ui/ChatMessageDelegate.h`, and stripped unresolved version control conflict markers from `src/context/ContextManager.h`.
* **Justification**: Cleaned merge markers to allow C++ preprocessor/MOC parsing. Solved template instantiation errors (`QCache<QString, QTextDocument>`) by providing full type definition of `QTextDocument` in the header. Provided `QMessageBox` definition for virtual deletion prompt signature.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-22 13:45

## UI: Explicit Default Button for Deletion Confirmation
* **Decision**: Set the default button in `QMessageBox::question` explicitly to `QMessageBox::No`. Added standard `// ##Action purpose` and verified `// ##Step purpose` and `// ##Condition purpose` annotations.
* **Justification**: Setting the default button to "No" prevents accidental destructive actions when the dialog is prompt-focused and immediately confirmed (e.g. by hitting enter). Annotations conform to codebase-wide prefix guidelines.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-22 13:41

## Testing: Headless-Safe Deletion Prompts
* **Decision**: Refactored the interactive `QMessageBox::question` dialog in `AiChatWidget::deleteCurrentConversation()` into a virtual protected method `askDeletionConfirmation()`. Overrode this method in a subclass `TestableAiChatWidget` inside the test suite to bypass GUI blocking.
* **Justification**: Executing blocking GUI prompts during automated tests in offscreen environments (`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`) stalls the pipeline indefinitely. Abstracting the confirmation into a virtual method allows clean mocking and full coverage of the deletion codepath without requiring user input.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-06 06:49\n* Successfully untracked massive local build cache directory (over 45k files) that was previously polluting the repository state.\n* Restructured the src/CMakeLists.txt to properly embed JSON metadata using KDevelop's kdevplatform_add_plugin macro, restoring standard KDevelop KF6 plugin discovery conventions.\n* Removed non-standard hotfix instructions from the README, restoring a standard KDE CMake build command set.\n\n**Timestamp**: 2026-07-03 04:14

## UI: Dynamic Layouts & Native Wrapping
* **Decision**: Removed `setMinimumHeight` and `setMaximumHeight` from `AiChatInputWidget`'s text box, utilizing `QSizePolicy::Expanding` and `QSizePolicy::MinimumExpanding` instead. Updated `AiChatWidget`'s vertical layout to assign a stretch factor of `1` to the chat history and `0` to the input widget.
* **Justification**: Hardcoded pixel sizing breaks IDE layouts on different resolutions and DPI settings, resulting in a "blocky" UI. By relying entirely on KDevelop's layout engine and Qt stretch factors, the sidebar natively expands and contracts seamlessly.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-03 04:12

## Architecture: Project Rebranding to KDev LLM
* **Decision**: Renamed core plugin files `JenovaPlugin` and `jenovakdev.json` to `KDevLLMPlugin` and `kdevllm.json`, updated all string literals, JSON plugin descriptors, and root `CMakeLists.txt` targets.
* **Justification**: To fulfill user request to align the plugin's branding explicitly with "KDev LLM". Using shell renaming before updating CMake targets prevented dangling references.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-03 02:01

## Architecture: Native IDE Project & DUChain Integration
* **Decision**: Upgraded `ContextManager.cpp` to pull data from `KDevelop::ICore::self()->projectController()` and `KDevelop::DUChain`. Used `KDevelop::DUChainUtils::itemUnderCursor` to extract semantic context (e.g. types and declarations) instead of parsing raw text, and pulled full project scope data. Fixed `ToolView` initialization by explicitly calling `CreateAndRaise`.
* **Justification**: The user demanded a *true* IDE integration, not just a Kate editor port. By linking against `KDev::Project` and `KDev::Language` and utilizing the AST Engine, the LLM now understands C++ types and project scopes semantically.

## Architecture: KDevelop Context Menus & Autocomplete
* **Decision**: Implement `KDevelop::ContextMenuExtension` inside `JenovaPlugin` instead of overriding `KTextEditor::MainWindow` XMLGUI files, and register `AiCompletionModel` globally by hooking into `KTextEditor::Editor::instance()->documentCreated`.
* **Justification**: This maps the Kate XMLGUI approach and model registration to native, clean KDevPlatform mechanisms. `ContextMenuExtension` natively hooks into KDevelop's right-click menus, while the `KTextEditor::Editor` global signals safely deploy our autocomplete model to all editors.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-03 01:38

## Architecture: KDevelop ToolView
* **Decision**: Implemented `KDevelop::IToolViewFactory` to register `AiChatWidget` via `core()->uiController()->addToolView()`.
* **Justification**: This maps the Kate `ToolView` concept to the native KDevPlatform architecture while preserving the inner chat UI logic.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-03 01:34

## Architecture: KDevelop Ground-Up Rebuild
* **Decision**: Pivot from `KTextEditor::Plugin` to `KDevelop::IPlugin` and scaffold in a parallel `src_kdevelop` directory.
* **Justification**: The user explicitly instructed that the project must be a proper KDevelop plugin rather than a Kate plugin, and demanded a complete ground-up rebuild without deleting the old files until the new plugin is fully functional.

## Architecture: Native KTextEditor Menus
* **Decision**: Replace `QMenu::addAction` in the `contextMenuAboutToShow` signal with native XMLGUI `<Menu name="ktexteditor_popup">`.
* **Justification**: Using KDE's XMLGUI framework correctly integrates the action into Kate/KDevelop without fragile code hooks, adhering strictly to the official KTextEditor plugin development process and preventing "reinventing the wheel".

## UX: Refactor Prompting
* **Decision**: Ask the user for explicit instructions via `QInputDialog` during a refactor request rather than silently issuing a generic "Refactor this code" prompt.
* **Justification**: AI refactoring without constraints leads to hallucinations and invalid output (e.g., C segfault examples). Letting the user specify the operation (e.g., "Extract function", "Optimize") and injecting full file context resolves logic gaps and transforms the placeholder feature into a functional tool.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-02 15:21

## Architecture: Reference Replication
* **Decision**: Extract `CommandTextEdit` into `AiChatInputWidget` and implement context menu hooks instead of deleting original classes or force-swapping whole codebases.
* **Justification**: Dumping an external repo into our project breaks FOSS rules and introduces massive tech debt. Integrating their UI logic (e.g. `@file` mentions and right-click menus) into our native classes preserves our clean `QNetworkAccessManager` backend and guarantees separation of concerns.

## UI: Code Completion Crash Fixes
* **Decision**: Remove manual `rowCount()` overrides. Rely strictly on KTextEditor's `setRowCount()` API natively synchronized with `beginResetModel()`.
* **Justification**: KTextEditor's base `CodeCompletionModel` utilizes complex internal Qt tree-structures based around its own internal `d->rowCount` pointer. Overriding the `rowCount()` function without using `setRowCount()` causes a severe data de-synchronization where KTextEditor attempts to iterate over internal arrays that have size 0 while the override falsely reports size 1, leading to immediate recursion loops and segmentation faults during UI rendering. Wrapping `m_completions` changes inside `beginResetModel()` completely stabilizes it.

## Network: QNetworkReply Abortion Lifecycle
* **Decision**: Remove `deleteLater()` calls immediately following `abort()` in `LlamaClient` network requests.
* **Justification**: When `QNetworkReply::abort()` is called, Qt synchronously emits the `finished()` signal on the main event loop thread before `abort()` returns. Our `finished()` slot natively captures this and sets the pointer to `nullptr` while calling `deleteLater()`. Executing a second `deleteLater()` immediately after `abort()` in the calling function results in a null pointer dereference (`nullptr->deleteLater()`), instantly crashing the application.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-02 14:43

## Architecture: LSP and Interpretation
* **Decision**: Retain Kate's basic `CodeCompletionModel` instead of writing a full out-of-process LSP server. Retain basic context aggregation instead of full project AST parsing.
* **Justification**: A Qt Plugin is fundamentally restricted from acting as an LSP server. Deep parsing is beyond the scope of a fast inference client. We mitigate this by ensuring the plugin operates correctly within its intended scope.


**Timestamp**: 2026-07-02 13:33

## Architecture: KF6 & Qt6 Native Plugin
* **Decision**: Target KDE Frameworks 6 exclusively.
* **Justification**: Modern KDE applications (Kate, KDevelop) have migrated to Qt6/KF6.
* **Impact**: Requires `kf6-*` packages and modern C++17/20.

## Backend: Local Llama.cpp REST API
* **Decision**: Communicate via HTTP POST using `QNetworkAccessManager`.
* **Justification**: Llama.cpp provides standard `/completion` and `/chat/completions` endpoints.

## Network: Async QNetworkReply Handling
* **Decision**: Overwrite ongoing requests by calling `abort()` and `deleteLater()` on the old pointers, and use `sender()` in slots.
* **Justification**: Prevents crashes or signal cross-talk when multiple requests (e.g., chat vs refactor) overlap asynchronously in `LlamaClient`.

## User Interface: Chat Interactions
* **Decision**: Implement `QEventFilter` on `QTextEdit` to capture `Enter` for sending messages, and auto-populate a welcome guide on load.
* **Justification**: Empty chat panels feel like non-functional stubs. Intercepting `Enter` matches standard chat UX and greatly enhances usability.

## Architecture: Native Integration
* **Decision**: Remove custom `ComparisonView` popup. Pipe LLM edits directly into `KTextEditor::Document` via `replaceText`.
* **Justification**: Custom popups fight the host IDE. Editing the native buffer lets the user rely on the IDE's built-in Git Diff and Undo functionality, shifting from a "slap-on app" to a deeply integrated native plugin.

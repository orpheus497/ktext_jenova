* **Reference Replication & Crash Fixes (Phase 12)**: Complete (Fixed `AiCompletionModel` live-typing crash by implementing `MatchRole`. Natively integrated `AiChatInputWidget` and context menu logic from reference projects).
* **Refactor Logic and Integration Fixes (Phase 13)**: Complete (Upgraded chat and refactor contexts to use full file content, replaced C++ context menus with native XMLGUI, and added user prompts for refactor operations).
- **2026-07-07 05:48**: Implemented a mitigation for HTTP insecurity on non-loopback IPs by adding warning logic to `LlamaClient` and `AiChatWidget`.
- **2026-07-08 00:45**: Refactored the security warning mechanism in `LlamaClient` into a private helper method that implements the warning, addressing code review comments without enforcing HTTPS or removing the exposure.

# Historical Session Summaries

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-02 15:14
* **Phase 12**: Performed a clean, non-destructive replication of `kate-code` chat autocompletion and `kdevcxx_with_ai` context menu logic. Resolved severe `KTextEditor` live-typing crashes by replacing invalid `beginResetModel()` calls with granular model insertion methods, preventing Qt segfaults during asynchronous AI generation. Successfully recompiled without external dependencies.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-02 14:49
* **Phase 11**: Added repository essentials including a Qt/CMake specific `.gitignore` and a comprehensive `README.md` documenting architecture, features, and building instructions. Verified the pre-existing `LICENSE` file as BSD 2-Clause compliant.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-02 14:43
* **Phase 10**: Investigated and fixed the IDE crash occurring during text edits. The crash was caused by `doc->lines()` generating an out-of-bounds `KTextEditor::Cursor` in `AiCompletionModel`. Clamped the cursor requests to the maximum valid line limit. Addressed missing chat controls by adding a "New Chat" button to `AiChatWidget` that clears the infinitely scaling message history array and resets the UI context. Concluded that a full LSP integration (diagnostics, symbol resolution) is structurally out of scope for a native Kate Qt-plugin; the current `CodeCompletionModel` is the correct, intended abstraction. Recompiled and installed successfully.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-02 14:22
* **2026-07-02 14:22**: Executed Phase 9 UI Refactoring. Referenced `kate-code` to identify that `createToolView` supplies a pre-laid-out widget. Repaired the broken layout assignment causing the plugin to squish into the top-left corner. Removed artificial stretch constraints and fixed autocomplete model display issues.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-02 14:09
* **2026-07-02 14:09**: Conducted a Phase 3 Discovery Refactor. Switched CMake from generic library building to native `kcoreaddons_add_plugin` to guarantee Kate/KDevelop detection via KPluginMetaData.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-02 13:58
* **2026-07-02 13:58**: Conducted a Phase 2 edge-case audit. Fixed fatal tab-switching data corruption, IDE double-free memory crashes, permanent UI hanging on network errors, and improved KDevelop JSON compatibility.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-02 13:51
* **2026-07-02 13:51**: Debugged and stabilized the plugin. Fixed broken XMLGUI bindings to restore the UI, secured text replacement with `MovingRange` to prevent async text corruption, and overhauled autocomplete model UX to prevent premature popup closures.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-02 13:33
* **2026-07-02 13:33**: Deleted UI tech debt and integrated natively via KTextEditor Document APIs, delegating Diff and Window logic to the IDE.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-02 13:24
* **2026-07-02 13:24**: Executed complete UI & branding overhaul. Renamed plugin to Jenova K Text, added a detailed UI instruction guide, and implemented Enter-to-Send functionality in the chat.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-02 13:16
* **2026-07-02 13:16**: Identified and resolved deep logic errors (network reply crosstalk), UI display issues in `ComparisonView`, injected markdown syntax bugs, and added required KTextEditor completion data roles.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-02 12:58
* **2026-07-02 12:58**: Investigated and fixed false implementations. Replaced hardcoded placeholders with actual LLM calls and repaired the AI refactoring logic.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-02 12:45
* **2026-07-02 12:45**: Conducted full source code audit; applied Code Documentation Standard prefixes to all C++ files.

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-02 12:39
* **2026-07-02 12:39**: Generated `.devdocs/` initialization files.

# Project Briefing

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-10 00:47

## Status
- **Current Phase**: Phase 21 (Consolidation & Merge).
- **Step**: Consolidating PR 14 branch into main, resolving merge conflicts, and updating installation process to proper KDE plugin paths.
- **Progress**: 100% - Successfully merged PR 14, resolved all conflicts, fixed build/tests, and updated installation instructions.

## Previous Session Accomplishments
- Implemented deep KDevelop integrations: DUChain AST extraction, `IProject` aware contexts.
- Rewrote the side panel initialization to natively obey KDevelop's layout engine without breaking.
- Hooked code completion injection natively into `IDocumentController` to support all KDevelop views.
- Fully rebranded the plugin from "Jenova AI / Jenova K Text" to **JCA KDev Plugin** featuring the **Jenova C.A.** UI persona.
- Updated the main `README.md` to reflect all architectural changes and deployment steps.

## Current Blockers
- Pending user approval to proceed with the PR 14 merge and conflict resolution.

## Recent Architectural Decisions
- Decided to stop using `.local` as a hotfix for KDevelop plugin installation; moving to standard KDE plugin paths requiring `sudo make install`.

## Next Execution Steps
1. Merge PR 14 branch `jules-14714858885759819008-c1fa69dc` into `main`.
2. Resolve merge conflicts in `src/context/ContextManager.cpp`, `src/ui/AiChatInputWidget.h`, and tests.
3. Update `README.md` to specify standard installation (removing `.local` prefix).

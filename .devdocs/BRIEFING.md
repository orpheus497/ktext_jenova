# Project Briefing

**Timestamp**: 2026-07-22 13:57

## Status
- **Current Phase**: PR 47 Merge Conflict Resolution — **COMPLETE**.
- **Step**: Resolved conflicts in sentinel journal, context manager, and test suites.
- **Progress**: 100%.

## Previous Session Accomplishments
- Completed full audit of all source/test/build files.
- Executed 6-phase implementation plan:
  - Phase A: Critical bug fixes (dangling pointers, stale range, response validation).
  - Phase B: Network robustness (60s timeout, stop methods, HTTP status checking).
  - Phase C: @file context injection via DUChain.
  - Phase D: KDevelop config page (Settings → KDev LLM).
  - Phase E: Completion debouncing (300ms).
  - Native chat UI refactor (QListView + QStyledItemDelegate + SQLite).
- 8 new files created, 12 existing files modified.
- Build verified: zero warnings, zero errors.

## Current Blockers
- None. All planned work is complete.

## Recent Architectural Decisions
- SQLite for chat history (user decision), stored at `~/.local/share/kdevelop/kdevllm/`.
- Native Qt widgets for chat bubbles (QPainter + QPalette), no HTML.
- DUChain-first extraction for @file context, with 200-line fallback.
- Tests deferred (user decision).

## Next Execution Steps
1. User testing: Install plugin and verify all features in a running KDevelop instance.
2. Expand test coverage when user is ready (Phase F, deferred).
3. Add conversation deletion UI to the history browser.
4. Implement chat title auto-rename based on first assistant response.
5. Add syntax highlighting to code blocks in the chat delegate.
